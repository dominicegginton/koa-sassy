## Documentation

### Start Serving SASS

To start compiling and serving SASS files pass **koa-sassy's** middleware to `app.use()`. **koa-sassy** comes with grate default options and makes complaining and serving SASS effortless.

``` js
app.use(sassy('/sass'))
```

### Mount SASS to path

By default **koa-sassy** mounts and serves all complied SASS on the `/` path. By setting the `options.mount` parameter it is posiable to mount your SASS to a specified path.

``` js
app.use(sassy('/sass', { mount: '/stylesheets' }))
```

This mounts your complied SASS to the `/stylesheets` path.

### Setting the Cache-Control HTTP Header

The [cash-control header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) holds directives (instructions) for caching in both requests and responses and is used to determine how long a given resource is considered fresh

**koa-sassy** makes it easy to control how long your stylesheet is considered fresh. Pass the maximum age in seconds in the `options.maxAge` perimeter

``` js
app.use(sassy('/sass'), { maxAge: 3600 }) // 1 hour
```

> **koa-sassy** default value for `options.maxAge` is 86400 (1 day), and will max out at 31536000 (1 year)

### ETags and Request Freshness

An [ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) is a identifer assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource, and passed to the client within the HTTP ETag header of the response. When the resource at a given URL is updated a new unique ETag is generated. **koa-sassy** uses the [**etag**](https://github.com/jshttp/etag) module to generate ETags.

Request freshness is determined by matching the current resources ETag against the ETag received from the [If-None-Match](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) HTTP request header. Fresh requests are responded with a status code of **304** (not modified) and stale requests are sent a status code of **200** along with the favicon in the response body. Support for ETags and freshness checking is built into **koa-sassy** by default.
